Hi folks...

made a small yet intresting and fun project of a Picture Carousel.

its easy and fun you guys should give it a try too.

this is actually a advanced iteration for the previous carousel it is has automatic switching functionality with manual overriding.

Technology/Concepts used -:

1) HTML

2) CSS

3) "FLEXBOX" for layout purposes 

4) Javascript (Document object Manupulation)
